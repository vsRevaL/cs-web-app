## Introduction

This application was one of my university assignments, it's basically a car-sharing/car-pooling `MVC` application containing

- `Guest` functions
- `User` functions
- `Admin` functions

**Carpooling** (also car-sharing, ride-sharing and lift-sharing) is the sharing of car journeys so that **more than one person travels in a car**, and prevents the need for others to have to drive to a location themselves.
